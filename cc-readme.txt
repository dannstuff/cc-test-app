Development Process - 

To begin the test, I first viewed the investments page that I would be recreating in order to plan how I would build the page.
I seperated the UI in to different categories, for example things I thought would be views and things I thought would be indidviual components etc.
I also planned to have a common 'Layout' component that renders all other views and would live at application level, as in a real production enviroment, 
there would need to be certain aspects of the UI that would be consistent across different views. I also ensured that I planned for a responsive UI that could be
viewed on both web and mobile devices. 

A constant thought in my mind was to develop the page and application as if it were a real production application, so I made sure to impliment standards like code consistentcy, 
a consistent file/directory structure and attempted to make all components as lightweight as I possibly could. Initially, I had planned to use Redux and possibly some 
server side rendering with Next JS, however I felt for the purpose of this singlular page, using both would possibly slow me down and could have been overkill and more expensive than benneficial.
Instead, I tried to focus on building small, lightweight, reusable components and keeping my code as clean as possible.
